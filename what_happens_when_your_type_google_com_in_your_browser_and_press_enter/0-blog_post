-> What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com in Your Browser and Press Enter?

When you type a URL and press Enter, a series of events occurs to load the requested page:

DNS Request: The domain is resolved to an IP address using browser, OS, or ISP DNS caches. If not cached, a recursive lookup is performed to contact authoritative servers.

TCP/IP: A connection is established with the server through a 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) for reliable data transfer.

Firewall: Client- and server-side firewalls check packets for security, blocking malicious traffic and allowing valid requests.

HTTPS/SSL: An SSL/TLS handshake encrypts the communication. The serverâ€™s certificate is validated, and a secure session key is generated.
Load Balancer: Traffic is distributed across servers to optimize performance and reliability, ensuring only healthy servers are used.

Web Server: A web server (e.g., Nginx) handles static content and routes dynamic requests to the application server.

Application Server: The application server processes dynamic content, performing backend logic and handling database interactions.

Database: Queries retrieve or update data, often using caching systems like Redis for frequent requests.
Response and Rendering: The response is sent back to the browser. The browser parses HTML, loads additional resources (CSS, JS), and renders the page.

This entire process happens in milliseconds, demonstrating the efficiency and complexity of web infrastructure.
